# Langster

## About
Langster is a web application for beginners learning foreign languages. It helps users build vocabulary through a gamified experience. The app is designed for all ages—children, adults, and seniors—and focuses on making learning simple and engaging with interactive tasks and progress tracking.

## Features
- **Gamified Courses**: Languages are split into modules and levels with tasks like flashcards, quizzes, and dictations. Users earn points for completing them.
- **Leaderboard**: See how you compare to other learners.
- **Progress Tracking**: View stats on your performance and completion rates.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Focuses on basic vocabulary for new learners.
- **Supported Languages**: English, Ukrainian, German, Spanish, French.

## How It Stands Out
- **Simple and Focused**: Targets vocabulary building, ideal for beginners before tackling grammar.
- **For All Ages**: Easy-to-use interface for kids, adults, and seniors.
- **Engaging Tasks**: Varied exercises (flashcards, quizzes, dictations) keep learning fun.
- **Competitive Element**: Points and leaderboards motivate users to keep going.
- **Handcrafted Lessons**: All content is created by the developer for quality and relevance.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB

## Future Plans
- Add new task types, like dialogue-based exercises.
- Support more languages.
- Include chat or forums for user interaction.
- Add timed challenges or competitive modes.
